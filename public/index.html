    <h1>Front-end Development is the Worst</h1>
    <p>
        Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who can't handle the real programming. I mean,
        it's just a bunch of divs and spans, right? And css??? It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaaaat
        red." What a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
        Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They code on Arch Linux, not Mac OS, and certainly not
        Windows. They use Vim, not VS Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the
        <a href="https://www.boot.dev">backend</a>, where the real programming
        happens.

        HOW THE SSG WORKS
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Delete everything in the /public directory.</li>
            <li>Copy any static assets (HTML template, images, CSS, etc.) to the /public directory.</li>
            <li>Generate an HTML file for each Markdown file in the /content directory. For each Markdown file:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the file and read its contents.</li>
                <li>Split the markdown into "blocks" (e.g. paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.).</li>
                <li>Convert each block into a tree of HTMLNode objects. For inline elements (like bold text, links, etc.) we will convert:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raw markdown -> TextNode -> HTMLNode</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Join all the HTMLNode blocks under one large parent HTMLNode for the pages.</li>
                <li>Use a recursive to_html() method to convert the HTMLNode and all its nested nodes to a giant HTML string and inject it in the HTML template.</li>
                <li>Write the full HTML string to a file for that page in the /public directory.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
